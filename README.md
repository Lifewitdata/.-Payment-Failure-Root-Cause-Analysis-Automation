# 📊 Payment Failure Root Cause Analysis & Automation

## 🔍 Overview
This project focuses on identifying, analyzing, and automating the detection of key reasons for **payment failures** in a fintech system. By working with large transactional datasets, the goal is to reduce operational overhead, improve product reliability, and enhance customer experience.

---

## 🎯 Objectives
- Identify top failure reasons from large-scale payment data  
- Perform root cause analysis using Python (pandas, seaborn, matplotlib)  
- Build automation pipelines for recurring insights and alerts  

---

## 📁 Dataset
- **Source**: Synthetic payment dataset generated for simulation  
- **Size**: ~100,000 rows, 12+ columns  
- **Key Fields**: `txn_id`, `timestamp`, `status`, `error_code`, `gateway`, `response_time`, `amount`  

---

## 🛠️ Tech Stack
- **Python**: `pandas`, `numpy`, `seaborn`, `matplotlib`, `datetime`  
- **Jupyter Notebook**: For interactive data analysis and visualization

## 📈 Key Findings / Results
- 🔹 **Top 3 error codes** accounted for over **70% of all failures**, most tied to payment gateway timeouts.  
- 🔹 Found that **evening hours (7–10 PM)** saw a spike in failure rates — likely due to high concurrency/load.  
- 🔹 Built an **automated summary generator** for top failure codes, timestamps, and gateways for daily reporting.
